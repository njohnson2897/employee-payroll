# Employee Payroll Bookkeeping

## Description
This project involved the creation of a program for a payroll manager to easily record and display the payroll information of a company's employees, as well as pick an employee from a random drawing and to log company-wide information like average salary.  The program already had working HTML and CSS code as well as the framework for some JavaScript functionality.  For this project, I added prompts for the "Add Employee" button that would request information from the user and return that information into an organized and sorted table on the webpage.  Additionally, I added the functionality for logging the average salary of the company's employees and picking a random employee as a drawing winner.
